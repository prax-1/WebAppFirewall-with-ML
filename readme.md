## Introduction

[This Project is an intelligent and adaptive firewall solution designed to enhance network security by leveraging machine learning algorithms. Unlike traditional 
firewalls that rely on predefined rules, this project employs advanced machine learning models to dynamically analyze network traffic, identify patterns, and make real-time decisions on 
whether to allow or block incoming and outgoing connections]

## Features

- [Dynamic Threat Detection: The firewall uses machine learning to dynamically adapt to evolving cyber threats, learning from historical data to detect new attack patterns.]
- [Customizable Rules: Users can define custom rules based on specific network policies, ensuring flexibility in firewall configuration.]
- [Anomaly Detection: The system identifies anomalous patterns in network traffic, providing an additional layer of defense against sophisticated attacks.]
- [Real-time Decision Making: Leveraging machine learning models, the firewall can make real-time decisions on allowing or blocking traffic without relying solely on static rules.]
