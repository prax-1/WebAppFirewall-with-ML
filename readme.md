# Web Application Firewall with Machine Learning

This project implements a simple web application firewall (WAF) that uses a machine learning model (Random Forest) to classify URLs as either malicious or safe. The goal is to detect and block potential security threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Features

- Real-time classification of URLs
- Integration of a pre-trained Random Forest model
- Use of TF-IDF vectorization for URL preprocessing
- Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - scikit-learn
  - joblib
  - tkinter (for GUI)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-app-firewall.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   '''bash
   cd web-app-firewall
4. Install the required packages:
5. Train the Model
6. python gui.py
